This is a project done in my DATA 301 class in the Winter Quarter of 2022. I created a machine learning model using snowfall data from 140+ stations along California's rivers to predict snowfall trends for the ski resorts in California. Within this project, I utilized JSON web scraping, cleaning and concatenating of columns and dataframes, plotting of basic information about the dataset, as well as creating the K-Nearest Neighbors plot used as the machine learning model.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy!
